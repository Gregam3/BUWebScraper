MAN_CITY|               Spotted on the bench yesterday! Where are we going with this lad? Could he do a job in this team?              <br>               <br> I have a suspicion Pep likes him.               |Gaudion M|27 Aug 2017 at 10:38 AM
MAN_CITY|               Did well at warming up but he was far from world class. 6/10               |TonyM|27 Aug 2017 at 10:45 AM
MAN_CITY|               If we sign Evans he'll be off, I think, don't dislike the guy but he's mainly occupied the physio table since his arrival.               |Cityfan|27 Aug 2017 at 10:46 AM

MAN_CITY|               Once Gundogan is fit he won't even make the bench. Needs to leave for his own sake               |Gundogan's Moustache|27 Aug 2017 at 2:08 PM
MAN_CITY|               Could he play lwb? I'm not a fan of having players in positions they're not familiar with, but maybe pep sees this as an option.               |Manchester_lalala|27 Aug 2017 at 2:14 PM

MAN_CITY|               He's an honest player who will always give his best, but as most have already stated, he has a poor injury record hampering his progress               |mosssideblue|27 Aug 2017 at 6:59 PM
MAN_CITY|               It's more his injury issues that have been a problem than anything. If he had been more available I reckon we'd have seen a lot more of him under Pep.               |mccity|27 Aug 2017 at 7:33 PM
MAN_CITY|               Well when he plays looks very good and u would think his fitness/energy suits Pep. He got MOTM in one game I remember he looked very good. Not sure whats going on with him and is he injured most of the time or just not selected? Is there something else going on we dont know about?               |MCFC_4Heatons|30 Aug 2017 at 4:14 AM
MAN_CITY|               I wouldn't be overly surprised if we actually saw Delph feature somewhat this season, providing he's not injured constantly. In fact, he might even make a decent backup LB if we need him to.               |mccity|1 Sep 2017 at 1:15 AM
MAN_CITY|               If he stays fit he's a very useful player as shown when he played towards the end of last season. He plays a position where we are desperately short as well as Dinho is not the player he once was.               |jaigurugoat|1 Sep 2017 at 10:24 AM
MAN_CITY|               Its a big ""if"" I know, but since he is still here, if he can stay fit he could be a valuable squad member. The left wing back position that Sane has struggled in seems perfect for him, even left back. Good work rate, decent in the tackle, more intelligent and technical than many give him credit for, and a decent passing range as well. We are thin at left back and holding mid - Delph (IF he stays fit) should be knocking on Pep's door asking to be involved at LWB.               |mdj0520|1 Sep 2017 at 2:25 PM
MAN_CITY|               Not disappointed that he stays, hopefully he will be given a chance.               |Tevez City|1 Sep 2017 at 3:39 PM

MAN_CITY|               One thing he does is shoot from range and he has a pretty good shot. I'd be tempted to try him in the fern role against the lower teams               |super_city_si|1 Sep 2017 at 4:53 PM
MAN_CITY|               He'll rot on the bench unless Yaya or Dinho gets injured.               |Dipsis_LTU_MC|1 Sep 2017 at 5:02 PM

MAN_CITY|               Should he be on the bench?               |Gabriel|1 Sep 2017 at 5:31 PM
MAN_CITY|               Always liked Delph and what he brings to the team. I wouldn't have minded either way if he stay or went, but when he's been used, he's been good.               <br>               <br> Agree with the LWB role, it has a chance of working.               <br>               <br> He honestly couldn't do much worse than Fern has done thus far, and I say this a big fan of Fernandihno and his qualities. Just has not looked good recently.               |VinceYoungisaBLUE|1 Sep 2017 at 6:08 PM
MAN_CITY|               I think, if Pep really doesn't fancy Yaya at the moment, give Fernandinho two or three more games to sort himself out and then give Delph a go. I remember him looking very good at Chelsea and home to Hull last season, including scoring a lovely goal.               |MarsLlama|1 Sep 2017 at 7:03 PM
MAN_CITY|               Honestly it's hard to believe that Delph is still in our side.              <br>               <br> He has enough potential that he could become pretty good, starting regularly for a P/L side.              <br>               <br> But I just don't see any scenario whatsoever that he will crack our lineup - we're massively deep at mid. The best Delph can hope for is game time in some ties we're not interested in winning or last minute appearances in games we've already run.              <br>               <br> Delph deserves much more than this - hope he's traded/loaned to a side that actually wants to start him.               |CityInWashingtonState|5 Sep 2017 at 4:21 PM

MAN_CITY|               Surely Delph has to look at how weak England are at CM and be motivated to work as hard as ever to make that side.               <br>               <br> Never has an England side been so weak and devoid of quality. Things might change though so he should be on it!               |mccity|5 Sep 2017 at 9:05 PM

For example, Mendy is our only LB and we are screaming for backup in that position, why can't he use Delph there? I don't trust the notion that well Pep knows best because he can see what we can't in training, because it took him a whole year to realize Sterling works best when attacking through the center.               |WallyA|6 Sep 2017 at 1:22 AM
MAN_CITY|               So if you said 6 months ago that Delph would get sub'd on when Gundogan and Sane were on the bench and Yaya hadn't made the squad you would have been laughed at!               <br>               <br> The game was done by the time he came on but I think the real talking point is that he got on!               <br>               <br> I have a suspicion Pep really likes him.               |Gaudion M|14 Sep 2017 at 12:28 PM
MAN_CITY|               Pep admires him for his work-rate and energy. He's got quite a good passing ability as well.               |Dipsis_LTU_MC|14 Sep 2017 at 12:36 PM
MAN_CITY|               will continue to be important squad player, I suspect he'll come on and do the Fernando role like last season, playing last 5-10 mins to close out games.               |rowarta|14 Sep 2017 at 12:38 PM
MAN_CITY|               Assume he come on over Gundogan simply because he is more suited to the busy anchor role.               |01cravend|14 Sep 2017 at 12:54 PM

Delph can deliver on that front and his passing is good (although looks fairly limited when compared with the likes of Yaya Silva and KDB etc). The fact he is left footed will also help as he could drop in behind Mendy to cover his runs. Every time he gets fit he seems to get involved so I guess if he stays fit we will see a fair bit of him this season.               |Gaudion M|14 Sep 2017 at 3:11 PM

MAN_CITY|               I reckon he could play quite a bit this season as along with Danilo hes basically the only cover for Fernandinho.

He's energetic and willing to press.

MAN_CITY|               Sounds a fare assessment and really what I was expecting, he does have qualities but are they what we require in the structure we play, is the major doubt. I always wondered if he was smart enough to adapt his game and become a left back.               |Chipmeister|21 Sep 2017 at 10:37 AM

If you look at it another way thsi season we have Mendy as first chopice LB. Second options are Sane as a wing back - this was a disaster. Delph at left back - was ok. He is willing, has the energy and mobility required in the system, can pass well and is a natural left footer so he can dive in with the correct foot (he got booked for a sliding tackle that was a marginal booking but my point is it helps to be a left footed player to slide in like that). All in all he was pretty good.               |Gaudion M|21 Sep 2017 at 8:33 PM

MAN_CITY|               He did ever so well today, even before his goal, which was an absolute screamer.               |Pam|23 Sep 2017 at 8:04 PM
MAN_CITY|               What a finish from him. He still has a role to play for us and it'd obvious that Pep sees something in him that will help us.               |Goater=Legend|23 Sep 2017 at 8:13 PM

MAN_CITY|               What an absolute stunner with his weaker foot. He can be very useful for us if he stays fit. Very versatile, technically he's great, can shoot from distance, passing wise he's OK too. People just hate him for whatever reason just like Raheem.               |Dipsis_LTU_MC|23 Sep 2017 at 9:31 PM
MAN_CITY|               Just needs to stay fit, the only thing holding him back.               |blue wang|23 Sep 2017 at 9:45 PM
MAN_CITY|               Judging by the way other team mates were jumping all over him at the end of the game, it seems he's a popular fella in the changing room as well!              <br>               <br> I like him, and if he can stay fit, he's a very useful additional to the squad.               |Kris_Musampa|23 Sep 2017 at 9:56 PM
MAN_CITY|               Always was a fan. Has a lot of energy and works hard for the team. What a goal!! Amazing curler with his weak foot.               <br>               <br> He decided to stay and fight than to go to Stoke. Delph is a good player, was captain at Villa also.               |Easy|23 Sep 2017 at 9:59 PM

MAN_CITY|               still don't believe he actually scored that goal. Must have been Dinho and everyone's just playing a joke on me.              <br>               <br> I mean, Delph, do something as good and worthwhile as that? Never...              <br>               <br> **Oooh look...a humble pie...nom**              <br>               <br> Let's see if he can back that up or whether it was just a nice fluke.               |BJL_City|24 Sep 2017 at 12:53 AM
MAN_CITY|               Yeah literally said to myself ""really?"" as he shot and then of course he curls in a beauty with his weak foot haha.              <br>               <br> The level of play from everyone has been great these last few weeks and looks like it's pushing even our players who don't feature much to perform.               |KCblue|24 Sep 2017 at 8:28 AM
MAN_CITY|               He seems a well liked player within the squad. His finish was lovely.               |BlueTG|24 Sep 2017 at 9:22 AM
MAN_CITY|               Great goal yesterday and good for him to get some minutes. He's definitely a viable back up to Mendy.               |City_Sean|24 Sep 2017 at 9:57 AM

MAN_CITY|               The moment you let fame go to your head, is when you listen to the crowd and try to curl it in with your right foot, but this time from forty yards. The look on Pep's face was equalled only by that on Delph's. :D               |Gabriel|26 Sep 2017 at 10:08 PM

Have said since Mendy came to us that he is great going forward and can certainly cross a ball but he's a bit clumsy and his defensive play needs a lot of work if he is to be one of the best players in the Premier League. However, having said that, I have no doubt he would have learnt what is needed in England. So, it's a great shame if he has a serious injury               |CC1|26 Sep 2017 at 11:08 PM

MAN_CITY|               Did well tonight but seemed to struggle a bit in the air, even came to the point where he took a few backward steps to anticipate the ball rather than go in for the header against his opponent.              <br> On the ground he was solid, with a bit of coaching he could easily add defensive responsibilities like Ferandinhio has to his game because I still think he has great potential to become a midfielder of the same mould.              <br> IMO he still has a lot more to offer before we mould him into a fullback.               |slick|26 Sep 2017 at 11:39 PM

MAN_CITY|               He’s always been injured so don’t know how he is underrated. Delph usually does well wherever he is asked to play for us. The problem is he has an injury record worse than, or at least rivals Vinnys, so don’t be surprised if it flares up again.               |Joe Hart's Dandruff|27 Sep 2017 at 12:54 AM

MAN_CITY|               Great performance by Delph last night. He made some genuinely great passes and defended much better than I expected him to. Will be interesting to see how our backline looks against Chelsea               |KCblue|27 Sep 2017 at 8:57 AM
MAN_CITY|               One of his best games ever for the club last night for me. Got stuck in good positional sense and made some great runs. Just hope he can stay injury free and continue in the same way.               |Mike D|27 Sep 2017 at 9:10 AM
MAN_CITY|               If Delph can play at LB in a game as tough as they gave us we should have the faith to start him there against most teams in the PL. He could have found a new role for himself, if he can learn to hug the touch line and cross from the left hand side why can't he be our LB? He can already support the attack I just can't remember him crossing any in from the touchline which would be important for Pep.               |Metalartin|27 Sep 2017 at 9:28 AM

MAN_CITY|               Who knew in June Delph would be starting for us in September. I thought he was a goner. But well done to the lad. Don't mind losing the offensive powers but we need to keep ourselves defensively solid. This chance could go either way. To be honest our season depends on him now.               |kupest|27 Sep 2017 at 12:16 PM
MAN_CITY|               Seemed better defensively last night than Mendy has so far this season. But full back is a huge part of our attacking game and he obviously doesn't bring the same qualities to the table.               <br>               <br> Hope he stays fit and makes the position his own until we can buy a specialist.               |SWP's back|27 Sep 2017 at 12:18 PM
MAN_CITY|               The line on Delph that I've read has been that he was a signing Mancini did not want - reports in the media were that Mancini felt sorry for Delph, as he was a hard worker, great in the dressing room, never complained - but was not talented enough ever to start regularly for City - in short, Delph was a signing that Mancini did not want and did not think helped the squad at all.              <br>               <br> Belying expectations, Delph filled in at LB against Shaktar - completely out-of-place - and performed very well - not looking at all out-of-place in our squad.              <br>               <br> Hopefully his performance wasn't some sort of aberration - we could dearly use backup at FB and if Delph can fill that role, it's huge for our team.               |CityInWashingtonState|28 Sep 2017 at 8:54 AM

MAN_CITY|               Apologies if already posted.              <br>               <br> from Football365's Mediawatch:              <br>               <br>               <br> In rude Delph              <br> Fabian Delph played at left-back for Manchester City against Shakhtar Donetsk. He was really good. He made three tackles, four interceptions and one clearance, and was crowned “man of the match” by manager Pep Guardiola after the game.              <br>               <br> David Anderson of the Daily Mirror was not wholly impressed. He says it highlights the ‘flaw’, the ‘uncharacteristic oversight’ in Guardiola’s squad.              <br>               <br> ‘Guardiola had probably not expected Aleksandar Kolarov to go, but the Serb’s head was turned by an offer from Roma,’ Anderson writes. ‘So it was left to Delph to smooth off his square corners and try to be a round peg in a round hole.              <br>               <br> ‘Guardiola had every faith in Delph because as a former midfielder himself, the Catalan believes they are the most intelligent players on the pitch due to their ability to play in defence and attack.              <br>               <br> ‘Delph was probably just glad to get a start and it was only his 21st in his two-and-a-half years at City.’              <br>               <br> Anderson does concede that Delph ‘did make a fine tackle’ at one stage and was ‘not overworked’, but he says that ‘bigger challenges lie ahead if Mendy remains out’.              <br>               <br> ‘Mendy driving forward for City from his left-back position has been a big plus for them this season and Delph did not do that.’              <br>               <br> No, but he did create two goalscoring chances, fewer than only David Silva and Kevin de Bruyne, and completed three dribbles, fewer than only Leroy Sane.              <br>               <br> Add the fact that full-backs under Guardiola often tuck into central midfield, as Anderson himself concedes in the piece, and that Danilo offers a more defensive option as Mendy’s replacement if needed, and you start to wonder what all the fuss is about.               |Rolee|28 Sep 2017 at 10:30 AM

MAN_CITY|               Usually really happy for our players when they are called up after an absence from their national teams (Danilo) but I can't help but think Delph and those as injury prone should be telling their managers that they want to make sure they are fit for an extended period first. Surely it is better for the national team to have the player fit?              <br>               <br> From an England point of view, great. We are lacking in that area and Delph is far better than Livermore and Henderson.               |mdj0520|28 Sep 2017 at 2:17 PM

MAN_CITY|               He looked like he'd been playing left back his entire career. Always a joy to see an under rated player shut us doubters up. I hope this makes him more of a regular even once Mendy is recovered.               |Dethred|30 Sep 2017 at 8:48 PM
MAN_CITY|               I don't understand why Pep didn't try him at LB last season. He was fit for half of the season but barely played and we had Kola and Clichy. Past is past, just being curious. MOTM for me. Just has to stay fit and we'll save 30 mil in January.               |Dipsis_LTU_MC|30 Sep 2017 at 8:56 PM

MAN_CITY|               Chuffed for him to be honest.              <br>               <br> I think he'll be our No.1 LB this season because of the flexibility it gives Pep for him to step inside and support the midfield. Allows Danilo to keep covering which is an important position for the season.               |Blue Coop|30 Sep 2017 at 10:37 PM

MAN_CITY|               He's been superb in the last two games. Always thought he could be an option at left back, and whilst it's still early days he looks a great fit. Hope he can stay injury free; if so he could save us a fair bit of money and a new contract is a certainty.               |Ric|30 Sep 2017 at 10:51 PM

MAN_CITY|               Hats off to those on here who said he could be a left back. I think the fact is he wouldn't get in ahead of our midfield right now when you think of Gundogan, DeBryune, Silva &amp; Silva so credit goes to him for taking this opportunity - who'd have thought? only a few...               |Mr HJ|1 Oct 2017 at 12:00 AM

MAN_CITY|               Keeps this up then we honestly don't need a left back and if we do it certain gives us a better foothold in negotiations.               <br>               <br> What a relief to not have to worry about that left back spot (touch wood he stays fit).               |MCFC1993|1 Oct 2017 at 1:10 AM

MAN_CITY|               Massive credit to Delph.              <br>               <br> Could of taken the easy route and went to Stoke but decided to stay at City not for the wages like many here suggested but to win his place and play a major role in a team competing for major honors.              <br>               <br> Love him. He has eve improved and is playing now much better than last season although he didn't play much.               |Easy|1 Oct 2017 at 9:31 AM
MAN_CITY|               I think Fabian Delph has been very underrated by City fans, probably because we have been fortunate enough to have signed some world class players. I don't like to use the vermin as an example but Delph could become our Denis Irwin. He was faultless yesterday and despite not being quite as potent as Mendy in the wide areas his tackling, positional play and passing was first class.              <br>               <br> I like to be proved wrong and I was big time yesterday because I thought our back four might not cope with the threat of Chelsea's forward line, when they did in fact snuff them out before they got in positions to hurt us.               |PW|1 Oct 2017 at 9:37 AM

MAN_CITY|               got caught out a little today, particularly for the 1st goal, needs to keep working hard on the LB role to give us good cover until at least Jan, maybe longer if he really hones it.              <br>               <br> Surprisingly refreshing that he's done a lot better than expected, and staggering that he manages to be better at it than 2 players who'd played left back all their careers (AK and Clichy). Still, it is naturally our weakest area and he's going to need a bit of help at times, and I think at 3-0 today we switched off and assumed job done and it allowed Stoke to nick 2 goals from down his side. Hopefully going forward we'll stay switched on and Sane come back and give him a little extra help.              <br>               <br> He's done really well but today did show that there's more to come.               |BJL_City|15 Oct 2017 at 1:09 AM
MAN_CITY|               He was at fault for their first goal. Ball watching and didn't know where Diouf was. Hopefully he'll eradicate these mistakes when he understands the position more.

MAN_CITY|               Playing very well at LB.              <br>               <br> At fault though for Stoke's first goal.              <br>               <br> For the first goal:              <br>               <br> Delph is aware of Diouf's position (initially offside, but wanders back onside) but is slightly out of position following the long pass from midfield into Diouf; it looks as if Delph thinks he can intercept the pass and takes a step towards the path of the ball; but Delph immediately recognizes that he cannot make the interception and then runs back at full pace to catch Diouf; this allows Diouf to turn in field. Diouf makes a nice pass to Jese. Delph moves back infield but is slightly out of position to cover Jese's one-two back to Diouf. Diouf is initially open and shoots, but Delph dives in to make a partial block - unfortunately the deflection sends the ball over Ederson and into the goal.              <br>               <br> It's the slightest of margins - but Delph simply needs to commit to covering Diouf as the midfield pass is made. His initial move to intercept the pass gets him in trouble, allowing Diouf to cut infield which ultimately leads to the goal.              <br> ==========              <br> That said, Delph is filling in admirably at LB, far, better than I could have hoped for. IMO, Delph has secured a spot in our squad as backup at LB - probably he can cover other positions as well (e.g., holding midfield).               |CityInWashingtonState|16 Oct 2017 at 2:17 PM
MAN_CITY|               Didn’t realise how tidy of a footballer he actually was until the last few games. Hardly ever gives the ball away. Another solid game from him!               |Domkeefe|17 Oct 2017 at 9:34 PM
MAN_CITY|               Considering he's basically a year behind the rest of the squad in terms of playing under Pep, I thought he did really well tonight under that insane pressing.               |domalino|17 Oct 2017 at 9:41 PM

MAN_CITY|               Few nervy things but eventually Fernandinho, who otherwise had his usual brilliant game, outdone him in this regard... One thing that is sort of lacking was his passing to his near teammates towards the end where we could have cut them to pieces but instead it was almost some 3 v 4 situations, not that I think that Mendy would have done better in this aspect or that Delph doesn't have his quite big advantages compared to him, so I guess all is well and yeah, his application is just lovely to see.               |Hungarian blue|17 Oct 2017 at 10:24 PM
MAN_CITY|               This is not going to go down well with a lot of people on here but he frightened me to death every time he received the ball. Mis-control and wayward passing contributed to a lot of Napoli's attacking forays. I admit Sane did little to help with protection on that flank.               |bulldogblue|17 Oct 2017 at 10:31 PM
MAN_CITY|               Obviously I wish Mendy was in this team for his attacking threat but as others have said he is doing very well in an unfamiliar position.               |David 'El Mago' Silva|17 Oct 2017 at 10:47 PM
MAN_CITY|               Needs to practice his rondo a bit. Although anyone outside the elite would struggle with that sort of pressing.               |mccity|17 Oct 2017 at 10:48 PM

MAN_CITY|               Really been surprised by him. Very intelligent positionally. And he seems to pick the right pass and make the right decision 90% of the time. Remains to be seen how good and useful he will be for us long-term. It seems like that we'll sign another LB this January.              <br>               <br> Which means that he will be back to being a midfielder. And that means a lot less game time.               |BlueCityfan|21 Oct 2017 at 8:06 PM
MAN_CITY|               I fully believe he can do a job going forward but is being wise and concentratinnf on defensive duties first. We have been targetted at left back in a few games due to his lack of height and Sane being a bit suspect at times so the clean sheet is excellent and he will no doubt show how good he is going forward as the season progresses. Great passinng and also pace to attack the box and allow more width (which Pep is clearly requesting).               |supercity88|21 Oct 2017 at 9:01 PM
MAN_CITY|               Like an actually fairly solid Clichy. Offers pretty much nothing going forwards, but isn't a liability defensively. We can get away with it when we're playing well and scoring for fun, but I can't see him being the one to really make the opening in a tight game in the way that Walker, Mendy or Danilo can. Doing a good job filling in, but still not entirely convinced he's a long term option as anything other than a utility guy to fill in and do an unremarkable but solid job               |BigOscar|21 Oct 2017 at 9:15 PM
MAN_CITY|               He's a very good football player.               |OB1|21 Oct 2017 at 9:20 PM
MAN_CITY|               Always thought he was a very decent centre mid. Wasn't sure about the idea of playing left back as the times Pellegrini played him on the left of midfield he looked a fish out of water even though it wasn't really his fault. Don't think it's that easy to just pick up another position like he has, the likes of Fernandinho and Navas did their best playing there but were average at best and a liability at worst. Delph looks comfortable, good positioning so far and like Guardiola says he will continue to play and help the build up where a natural fullback may have run out of ideas. Now just please stay fit.               |Love_Each_Day|21 Oct 2017 at 9:29 PM
MAN_CITY|               He offers an extra man in the midfield. He moves into midfield when in possession where he is comfortable, only moves to LB to defend.               |kupest|21 Oct 2017 at 10:39 PM
MAN_CITY|               He looks like a player transformed to me. I wouldn't have known left back wasn't his normal position just from watching him play. I think it's been great for him as he is getting to play and make a real contribution versus sit the bench with our crowded midfield. And it has been great for the team as well as he stepped right in when Mendy went down and we don't look weaker for it. A real positive in a season of them so far. Four goals conceded in nine league games tells the story.               |SkyBlueTX|21 Oct 2017 at 10:40 PM

MAN_CITY|               Delph has been a revelation , if the lad can keep fit we do not need another left back , he has a great attitude and appears to be a very popular squad member , the fact that he is English is a bonus because Pep will improve him as a player ten fold which can only be good news for our world cup hopes/prayers along with Stones , Walker and Raheem               |jimmygrimblesboots|23 Oct 2017 at 11:50 PM

MAN_CITY|               He's like a second Fernandinho mopping up stuff in the middle, but also a left back....it's genuinely mind-boggling sometimes, it's that Kante-esque feeling that he's in 2 places at once.               |domalino|1 Nov 2017 at 9:55 PM

MAN_CITY|               Huge credit to delph.

MAN_CITY|               I'm just really hoping Mendy gets back to fitness ASAP now. Fabian is doing a great job but I've seen enough in him to play in Ferns role over the last few weeks.              <br>               <br> He was talking to stoke I think in the summer, and Pep used him fleetingly last season and often joked he should use him more. I'm not sure he meant it at the time, but I think now he's seeing how valuable he really is.               <br>               <br> He's a great utility player and vastly underrated.               |Proy|2 Nov 2017 at 1:58 AM

Switch the stats from ""Total"" to ""per game"" or ""per 90 minutes""              <br>               <br> The latter latter 2 being better measures than over All totals. That favors who has had more playing time.              <br>               <br> That said, even when that adjustment is made, Delph is still walking the overall stats. Even the attack score. But that is exaggerated by the fact that he has a goal and the other 3 don't.              <br>               <br> If you dig deeper and look at assists, key passes and chances created. You'd see that Mendy is actually (as the eyes suggest) far superior attacking wise.              <br>               <br> But yes, that Delph is still considered a midfielder playing fullback many underestimate the fact that he simply is a very good fullback... Period...              <br>               <br> I get tired of hearing pundits and even our fans say things like ""he has done okay for a midfielder."" He hasn't. He is playing at top end in European fullback levels.              <br>               <br> I want to tear my hair out anytime I hear folks point out how him not being a natural fullback has anything to do with missed tackle or being out of position one time or the other.              <br>               <br> I mean, are natural fullbacks never out of position?

MAN_CITY|               So pleased for him after his problems with injury whilst at the club.              <br>               <br> Getting regular games seems to be helping him show what he is capable of. A very good example of how players get written off unfairly at times.               |Colin Bells Boots|3 Nov 2017 at 9:56 AM

MAN_CITY|               I thought he should have left and would be wasting his time sticking around.              <br>               <br> Fair play his decision to stay is looking spot on, for him and for us. He's been brilliant.              <br>               <br> If he stays fit he has such a great opportunity due to our lack of alternatives, keep up these performance levels and surely at some point the position will become his to lose?               |pee dubya|3 Nov 2017 at 10:12 AM

MAN_CITY|               Really happy for the lad. Feel he's now definitely got a place in this City squad for the foreseeable future, and at only 27, he's got many years ahead of him. We need versatile players like him.              <br>               <br> I'd really like to see him in Fernandinho's role at some point this season. Obviously difficult with Mendy's injury, but I feel Delph really could shine there (and we did see that last season vs Chelsea, for example). His technical ability is actually really good, as well as his work rate and pace. He's not a wildly dissimilar player to Dinho in my eyes.              <br>               <br> I still feel like signing a player like Bertrand in January might be a good option. Depth at the LB role to rotate with Delph, who cannot play every game until Mendy is back in April (probably at the earliest). Having an option like Bertrand would also allow Delph to then rotate with Dinho, who again, will have some much needed depth going in to the business end of the season.               |charlie9872|3 Nov 2017 at 11:31 AM

MAN_CITY|               Thought it was a pretty cowardly challenge by Ozil on Delph in injury time. No interest in, or intention of playing the ball, just a quick look to see where Delph was and barged straight into him. Ozil looked like he wanted an extra rest game tagged onto the international break and tried to get sent off, that's up to him, but we've seen how easily 'nothing incidents' end in serious injuries and to put a fellow pro at risk because of your own petulance was out of order in my view.               |Bozzie|6 Nov 2017 at 9:53 AM

MAN_CITY|               Mahrez got by him once in the first half and after that was completely shut down.              <br>               <br> What a game but Delph. No chance Mendy would be putting anything close to these type of defense performances IMO.               <br>               <br> One of the best left backs in the league right now without a doubt.               |Easy|18 Nov 2017 at 5:47 PM

MAN_CITY|               Could have gone elsewhere, could have rotted in the stand and picked up his cash, but he chose to stay and fight his way back into the team.

MAN_CITY|               Delph's transformation into arguably the best left back in the league (on current form, at least) could possibly be Guardiola's greatest achievement at City.               |Ric|19 Nov 2017 at 12:20 AM
MAN_CITY|               With each passing game he's making me feel guilty that I said in the summer that '£12m is a great offer from Stoke'! Originally thought he wouldn't get over his injuries but I was completely wrong. Sorry about that Fabian!              <br>               <br> Been nothing short of brilliant and seems like a top lad as well.              <br>               <br> The way he handled Mahrez today was superb.

MAN_CITY|               he's doing very well, but at some point Sane will need a rest and he's going to be asked to do more on that left wing going forward.               |BJL_City|19 Nov 2017 at 1:46 AM
MAN_CITY|               He is doing fantastic job but ""best left back"" and such stuff might be a bit of over-excitement. Best left backs in modern football are offering much more up front, he's lucky he has wonderful Sane in front of him and really barely has anything to do in attack with Sane in such form so he can focus on doing defensive job which he is doing over all odds and hopes I had.              <br>               <br> From what I've seen from Mendy in those few games he is easily better than Mendy in defensive part but Mendy is just miles ahead in attack so it should be interesting to see what Pep is going to do with this pleasant situation. To give us more Sane up front and more solid back up behind in Delph or go full mental for attack with Sane and Mendy who could possibly block some of Sane's work on the wing. Guess there might be mix of both but will be interesting to see what option will Pep prefere. Guess Mendy's one though, he is just crazy for goals and good crosses.              <br>               <br> Guess Delph could be cover for all kind of things. left back, DM, even CB.               |Jesus Cheekbone|19 Nov 2017 at 2:03 AM

Pep did this with Lahm and Alaba because while Pep knew both players could bomb down the wing like traditional attacking fullbacks, they were much better utilizing their midfield qualities and allowing truly pacy dangerous wingers like Costa and Coman bomb down the wings.                 </div>                 <div class=""quoteExpand"">                  Click to expand...                 </div>                </blockquote>                </aside>               </div>This.

MAN_CITY|               He’s been absolutely fantastic. If we’d have signed LB cover for £30m and they were performing like Delph was now we’d all be screaming bargain. Fair play to the lad for stepping up, clearly a very intelligent footballer and that seems very appreciated by a manager like Pep.               |Blue Coop|19 Nov 2017 at 10:24 AM

MAN_CITY|               He's a better fit than mendy in this current system that pep uses. There's no two ways about it and mendy will be 2nd choice lb or rotational when he comes back. With the way pep sets the team its all about control for when the team has the ball and when it doesn't. Meaning the full backs come inside when the team is building an attack as all the attack goes through silva and de bruyne who then almost always have an outlet in the wingers. The full backs don't need to provide any sort of attacking threat as there's five players in the team that provide that. On the rare occation they are allowed to overlap when the team is on the counter to overload the opposition and create more options but 90% of the time they just have to tuck in when the team is building an attack to minimise the threat of a counter and to offer control.              <br>               <br> Delph is a better 1 on 1 defender, has better positional awareness, much more composed on the ball in playing from the back, better discipline in his play, and more intelligent as well. The only advantage mendy has over him atm is a better delivery cross and maybe slightly better pace but outside of that delph wins in every category of what's most important to be a full back in the current system the team uses. This is not to be a slight on mendy who is still very talented and once his defensive side improves which it will with pep he will become a beast in that position but atm he lacks a lot in that side of his game that he may be a liability for the team if he plays there. This is also not a knee-jerk thing as my first impression and post about mendy last season was that I thought he was a faster version of kolarov which can be a plus or a negative whichever way you want to look at it.               <br>               <br>               <a href=""https://forums.bluemoon-mcfc.co.uk/threads/its-quiet-a-new-dawn.327493/page-281#post-10143475"" class=""internalLink"">http://forums.bluemoon-mcfc.co.uk/threads/its-quiet-a-new-dawn.327493/page-281#post-10143475</a>               |Callum Ramsey|19 Nov 2017 at 2:55 PM
MAN_CITY|               Hard to find words with enough gravity to express my joy for him. The lad never moaned and kept training hard, i assume he trusted in his skill and was ok to wait. He is getting that paid back in buckets now and he deserves all the plaudits he is getting.              <br>               <br> It angered me we benched a very good midfielder and is my main gripe with Pellegrini. You could see a player in him but he was not given a fair chance. I must also be super grateful to Pep for this to.               |TCIB|19 Nov 2017 at 3:00 PM
MAN_CITY|               Assuming we get Sanchez I think Mendy will be a better foil for Sanchez as Sanchez is right footed and cuts in leaving space outside whereas Delph is a better option with Sane who works back a little less but Delph coming inside allows Sane more space out wide.               |Cityfan|19 Nov 2017 at 3:22 PM

On the ball he has everything Pep wants in his fullback I.e. the comfort, vision and technique of a cultured midfielder. He also has the anticipation and aggression of a good fullback. So all he really needs to do is learn the easiest part of playing fullback, positioning.              <br>               <br> If he can do that, then he can become another utiliry playet worth his spot on the squad.              <br>               <br> If not, we can get a CB/LB combo guy like Martin or Hernandez.               |Dax777|19 Nov 2017 at 5:49 PM

Keeping him was a no brainer if he wanted to stay - as a Home Grown player he wasn't keeping anyone else out the squad, when fit he has never let us down, he is a good solid player who could clearly fill a number of roles. From his point of view it was a risk - in most other sides he would be a guaranteed first pick, it's a World Cup year and he will want to be in the England squad - but he must have seen enough and been confident enough in his own ability to know that he would get a chance at some point, and when he got that that chance would take it. We all just need to hope that playing regularly helps him through his past fitness issues and he finishes the season with the medals he deserves.               |cyan|19 Nov 2017 at 8:30 PM

Rotating them vigorously and consistently might actually be the best way to protect both.                  <br>                   <br> For me Zichenko simply needs to grow as q makeshift Leftback. On the ball he has everything Pep wants in his fullback I.e. the comfort, vision and technique of a cultured midfielder. He also has the anticipation and aggression of a good fullback. So all he really needs to do is learn the easiest part of playing fullback, positioning.                  <br>                   <br> If he can do that, then he can become another utiliry playet worth his spot on the squad.                  <br>                   <br> If not, we can get a CB/LB combo guy like Martin or Hernandez.                 </div>                 <div class=""quoteExpand"">                  Click to expand...                 </div>                </blockquote>                </aside>               </div>I agree a loan might be the answer if a suitable player could be found via that route.              <br>               <br> OZ's pace is questionable and looks a potential drawback in the position.               |OB1|19 Nov 2017 at 8:40 PM

MAN_CITY|               Great move pulling out of the England games for his fitness. Another who's not doubted his potential but I genuinely did not think he would be this good at LB, DM yes, you could see there was a footballer there waiting to get a run.

MAN_CITY|               Think he's been poor the last 2 games.

MAN_CITY|               Both Southampton and Huddersfield played right on top of him. Deliberate. Every goal kick. Every long ball. Every attack. Down our right side.              <br>               <br> It's become a tactic, a way for people to try and beat us. It's also dependant on who is in front of him, Leroy is inconsistent defensively and today he had nothing to protect him.              <br>               <br> So based on that, I think he's done very well. Yes he lost the flight of the ball today, but equally Gundogan should be stopping that cross.              <br>               <br> Very happy with and for him this season.               |Proy|30 Nov 2017 at 12:35 AM

MAN_CITY|               He's been just above average overall, which for someone playing out of position is excellent and the great form of the side has meant he has proved adequate. He's not a fantastic left-back, but fantastic left-backs are hard to come by (There's only about 5 or 6 better than him in the league). I still think we'll go for a natural left-back in the summer (or maybe in Jan) so I hope he gets to keep a squad role in midfield or as a utility man. Great character, seems to get on with everyone at the club.               |kun|30 Nov 2017 at 3:42 AM
MAN_CITY|               He's the left back equivalent of when Jimmy played up front for us.              <br>               <br> Does a job, not his long term position.              <br>               <br> Not sure anyone expects world class performances. Decent will do until Mendy comes back and/or January.              <br>               <br> Although, people were using the ""name a better LB in the league"" when Kolarov was here... But with the overall standard of LBs in the PL it's like being at a fat camp and being the least fattest kid there.              <br>               <br> Fullbacks in general imo, not a blessed department depth wise in the PL for my money.               |pudge|30 Nov 2017 at 4:07 AM

MAN_CITY|               I think we must buy a left back in the window.

MAN_CITY|               got caught ball-watching for the goal, lost his man at the back post. He's done well but the weaknesses of the patch-up have come through in the past 2 games.

This is just a narrative some have wanted to peddle since his first game. His performance had just been too stellar for them to pretend in the past. He has now had an average game. Guess who else has the last 3 games? Debryune! Should we get someone too?              <br>               <br> Lest we forget the goal came from.a cross on the other flank. He just made a mistake in judging the flight of an overhit ball that carried beyond the danger area.              <br>               <br> 1. The position isn't foreign to him.              <br> 2. He is not being targetted. Teams can barely get out of their own half, talk less devising some fake ""target Delph strategy"". I mean he did just pocket Mahrez 3 games ago right?. And the next game Hud didn't get a shot on goal and barely left their half.              <br>               <br> So by he is been targeted, what you guys really mean is ""he misjudged the flight of a ball coming from the other flank"", right? Got it!              <br>               <br> Say he doesn't provide width, I'd give you that. But I think that's just Pep, instructionally playing to his strengths. Anyone who has watched a bit of him before he came here knows he can whip in a mean cross and is quite a capable dribbler.              <br>               <br> But his remit, in other to get the best out of him and for the team, is to play invertedly. This is by design. Not an individual flaw.               |Dax777|30 Nov 2017 at 11:17 AM

He's essentially being used as a defensive fullback in a team that doesn't have much defending to do. The vast, vast majority of our games from here on out are going to be attack versus defence and in those games, he's a bit of a passenger. When teams park the bus you need to get in behind them in the wide areas and fullbacks are a huge part f that (as we saw last year with Clichy and Sagna).              <br>               <br> The one aspect of his game that has impressed me though is his passing under pressure in our own half, when teams press us he has stood up and been genuinely impressive, but that's not a skill we need very often.               |BigOscar|30 Nov 2017 at 2:17 PM

When teams park the bus you need to get in behind them in the wide areas and fullbacks are a huge part f that (as we saw last year with Clichy and Sagna).                  <br>                   <br> The one aspect of his game that has impressed me though is his passing under pressure in our own half, when teams press us he has stood up and been genuinely impressive, but that's not a skill we need very often.                 </div>                 <div class=""quoteExpand"">                  Click to expand...                 </div>                </blockquote>                </aside>               </div>Tbf, he might not be the best winger, but if I have to choose who has the ball 20-30 yards from the oppo goal, I'd prefer it to be Delph rather than walker, 9 times out of ten.               |Neville Kneville|1 Dec 2017 at 7:49 AM

MAN_CITY|               Would be good in a 2/3 man midfield but not as a lone anchor. Very left footed which slows his passing down as he has to move the ball onto his favoured foot whilst Dinho is comfortable pinging it off either.              <br>               <br> Think he is better defensively than Dinho though.               |01cravend|4 Dec 2017 at 1:39 PM

MAN_CITY|               I think the occasion affected Delph and Walker more than it did the foreign players because of what it represents to them(means a little more to English players to get one over on United), that's just my guess/interpretation on what I saw obviously but both of them had shaky moments that were out of character in comparison to the majority of matches this season.

MAN_CITY|               I liked his post match interview yesterday where he admitted he's still learning but you can tell he really wants to learn and has the type of attitude that any top club would want.              <br>               <br> Don't think he was really at fault for the goal, most left backs would have misjudged the ball after Otamendi's missed header.

MAN_CITY|               You have to love the lad, his interview after the scum game was refreshingly honest and he took one for the team (I thought it was Otamendi’s fault). That and his down to earth attitude of saying he’s still learning a new position and will make mistakes is one of the reasons I think Delph is so popular in the dressing room and players with his mindset are what Guardiola loves and one of the main reasons our team spirit is seemingly so high at the moment.               |fatbloke|13 Dec 2017 at 11:57 PM

MAN_CITY|               Glad he is over his injury problems and is getting a run of games , not a natural left back but is certainly learning the position on the job ! He also has the ability to bring the ball into midfield and play , another player who is proving a lot of people wrong , must be nailed on for a World Cup place , even Southgate can't cock that one up.               |jimmygrimblesboots|16 Dec 2017 at 11:41 PM

MAN_CITY|               He is so intelligent. Presses at the right time. Rarely makes a mistake. The first goal came through his pressing.               |BlueCityfan|23 Dec 2017 at 5:58 PM
MAN_CITY|               His thread is so quiet because he's being so quietly efficient. You compare him to Kolarov who would bounce around between fantastic &amp; abysmal quite regularly, and it really is quite impressive.               <br>               <br> May not be as attacking a threat as a Kolarov or Mendy, but he's surprisingly good defensively, and better in possession than both - almost never gives it away, which aids both sides of our game to no end.               |BlueMedic|23 Dec 2017 at 6:56 PM

MAN_CITY|               Delph was so good against Bournemouth we're almost forgetting Fernandinho's (who also had a cracking game, this is Pep's ingenious mantra, we play for the team), left foot cross, when did Fernandinho have a left foot for our opener against a stubborn team.

MAN_CITY|               I'e always like delph. I think it' the no-nonsense northern lad atttude he has. I'm made up for him having such a good season after so many injury issues.               <br> He will now go down as a vital contributor in our best ever team.....and not a crock who faded away.              <br> I hope he continues his form and fitness to cement his place in the England side this summer.               |burning blue soul|24 Dec 2017 at 7:22 AM

MAN_CITY|               Delph and Mendy are two amazingly contrasting left backs, Mendy allows us to play two strikers by being a marauding LB and Delph allows us to control midfield through playing as an inverted full back (i didnt even know this was a role until pep came here lol).               |lmjones1uk|24 Dec 2017 at 10:25 PM
MAN_CITY|               So happy for Fabian. He has worked very hard for this opportunity and has grabbed it with both hands. He will win silverware this year without a doubt.               |Saddleworth2|24 Dec 2017 at 10:29 PM
MAN_CITY|               Fabian was one of those talents you `d hope would come good. A class player and another inspiration to young kids as he has changed his game to suit the modern football team philosophy. Like the               <i>Great Blue <b>Jimmy Milner</b>, </i>Fabian has proved himself a talent by excelling in other clubs and becoming a fine footballer. The credit he deserves most is for his application out of his favoured position, he has been amazing. I hope he gets rewards for a great season , glad he is a Blue.               |ali benarbia's studs|27 Dec 2017 at 1:03 PM

MAN_CITY|               I'm starting to think we really might not need to buy a left back. Delph has looked excellent, Danilo can do the job there, Zinchenko can also to a lesser proven extent. All while Angeliño is doing excellently out on loan. When Mendy comes back (whom we all expect to be a phenom eventually) we should have plenty of cover and we can assess in the summer. Question would be do we think we can get to the later stages of the CL without another LB this season, I think we can. Maybe a CB (Iñigo please not Evans) but that would be it.               |kun|30 Dec 2017 at 4:40 AM
MAN_CITY|               How do you feel about him in a Fernadinho-like role? Would he do a good job there?              <br>               <br> If so, maybe we could look at Bertrand to act as one of our two main full backs, together with Mendy once fit, and let Delph play in the midfield? We would then have Mendy, Bertrand, Delph and Danilo, all very capable of playing at the left full back position, and Fernandinho, Delph and Danilo whom all could play as our anchor.              <br>               <br> Would it be a possibility?               |Matt the Giant|30 Dec 2017 at 5:15 PM

MAN_CITY|               I thought Fabian played very well today. Generally kept their winger and fullback quiet, pressed on when needed, and controlled possession from the left flank, creating a solid base for attack.              <br>               <br> He is a testament to his and Pep’s football intelligence.               |SebastianBlue|2 Jan 2018 at 11:23 PM
MAN_CITY|               Someone asked on Reddit if he would be a functional fullback for other teams, my thought was ""well sure"". He's just very effective in the role he's playing now, if there was ever a doubt about some of his skills for a rather ""all rounders"" position like that i would think he has proven it now after so many games. He's defensivly solid and that was i guess the main concern as he has nothing lacking in the attacking compartment. He must be pretty concentrated i guess to remain in that role when he was used to play different positions nut he does fine at that.               |FlemishDuck|3 Jan 2018 at 6:02 AM

MAN_CITY|               The left back position is far more of a concern than any central defender in my opinion.              <br>               <br> If Delph gets injured for a lengthy period then not only does Danilo have to play every game at left back, but Walker has to play every game at right back.              <br>               <br> I personally would bring in a left back over a central defender and just focus on that arrival being our main 2nd choice left back to a Delph this season.              <br>               <br> I can’t see Mendy being back this season at a high level.              <br>               <br> He will likely be back in April and even then it will probably take a month of games to get going again.               |cadds92|6 Jan 2018 at 3:00 PM

MAN_CITY|               Not sure why Delph is rested for a lot of games , i suspect there could be underlying injury issues he never appears to play two or three games in a week . Hope he is fully fit for the Dippers he's no shrinking violet and we will need his experience and attitude at Klanfield.               |jimmygrimblesboots|7 Jan 2018 at 1:34 AM

MAN_CITY|               I think it's right to protect Delph as much as possible and having Zinchenko play more games will also ensure he improves as a player too. Just hoping Delph will be fit for the Liverpool game next Sunday.               |City_Sean|7 Jan 2018 at 10:50 AM
MAN_CITY|               No reason to take a risk and rush Delph back IF he is injured (I just don't know).              <br>               <br> Walker seems ok, that's important!              <br> Danilo or Zinchenko could cover LB at Anfield. Both of them can put in a good fight.               |St.Pauli support|7 Jan 2018 at 11:00 AM
MAN_CITY|               Honestly don't even know if Mendy will be a starter when fit, Delph has taken the role in stride and is so confident on the ball and very good defensively. Sometimes I see people mentioning that attacking 'overlapping' fullbacks are the best and maximize a team's potential but I disagree, Pep hardly used them at Bayern and had Lahm and Alaba play inverted as well.              <br>               <br> Delph playing inside gives David Silva midfield cover, allowing him more freedom. I guarantee if we switched to Mendy playing a very attacking role then Silva would have to drop to give some cover, or we would have to play 3-5-2 which drops our wingers (the merits of which are debatable I guess).              <br>               <br> Delph is also better on the ball than Mendy and (from what I've seen so far) better defensively. Now obviously we paid alot for Mendy so he will play, but whether he will be the undisputed number 1... I don't think so.               |WallyA|8 Jan 2018 at 6:05 PM

As with ball recovery, I understand the argument but Walker actually plays inverted as well, and when he does go wide (which he does more often than Delph I agree), Kevin regularly drops to cover him. In fact between David and Kevin, Kevin is the one who plays deeper while David likes to play higher. This actually suits us because Kevin has a much better range of passing than David, while David has amazing dribbling, and ball control that is an asset further up the pitch. For sure David would play deeper with Mendy on, I don't see a way around that unfortunately.               |WallyA|13 Jan 2018 at 6:11 PM

MAN_CITY|               That is bad news. Pep played an absolute blinder replacing Mendi with such a high class replacement many never saw. Now the replacement is out that leaves our very capable utility back (Danilo) as a starter. We are now, i think it is fair to say, pretty much on our arse considering what we are trying to win/do/achieve.              <br>               <br> If the players are not on the pitch due to injury it does not matter who you are, not even Pep can maintain us without reinforcements.

Mendy is the dogs bollocks but we lost him. Of all the advancement we have overseen, Delph having to go to left back and performing like he has has been the move of the season, even though we had him from the start.

MAN_CITY|               Playing Delph against Wigan away as a CM in the cup is a very good idea. Gives him a run out in his preferred position, whilst also affording us the chance to give Dinho a rest ahead of a huge week for us.               |City_Sean|12 Feb 2018 at 11:04 PM

MAN_CITY|               Very good tonight. A little rust here and there but some of the tackles he put in, including two I counted that were last ditch challenges stopping dangerous moves on the edge of our box, were outstanding.               |SebastianBlue|14 Feb 2018 at 2:20 AM

MAN_CITY|               me and a mate had an argument that players like Delph shouldn't move to clubs like City for their own sakes; they're not going to play much, probably impact their own career at both club and country level (and may be seen by some to be money grabbers).              <br>               <br> I countered and said 'surely if you want to be the best player you can be you should take a plunge at trying to break into an XI like City or Chelsea etc'. Even if you barely play, you still tried. And anyway, what's wrong with a big pay cheque if that club rates you?              <br>               <br> Turns out it took 2 seasons of looking not that likely for Delph, then an injury situation which thrust him into an unfamiliar position. I wonder how many players who have been judged to have made the 'wrong career move' have been written off too early? suppose there's no way of knowing.              <br>               <br> hats off to the lad, honestly, hats off.               |shemnel|19 Feb 2018 at 4:55 PM

MAN_CITY|               Wasn't the first shit challenge he made since he's with us.

MAN_CITY|               Pep was probably incensed because we have suffered over ten leg breakers recently and the opposition only receive yellows or a handshake from the officials , we make one strong tackle with no danger to the player and its a straight red because the Scouse Wigan manager wanted a red. Can well understand why he was livid , but the crux of the situation , why did Delph make the tackle ? The player was going nowhere , its f*cking Wigan whats he gonna do sprint 80 yards and score a worldy ? Our full backs ultimately cost us the game Delph for the daft tackle and Walker for the mistake for the goal and if we repeat these mistakes we will some days lose again.               |jimmygrimblesboots|20 Feb 2018 at 1:18 AM
MAN_CITY|               It was a red, I don't understand those who pretend it was not.               <br>               <br> Senseless on Delph's part. I get the outrage at the ref for changing his mind after pulling out a yellow. But on first view, I thought it was a red and he was lucky to be getting a yellow.               <br>               <br> Unfortunately, Wigan's players were able to change his mind. The ref is a bastard for doing that. But it was a red :(              <br>               <br> It didn't cost us though. Walker did               |Dax777|20 Feb 2018 at 2:33 AM

MAN_CITY|               Why someone would give a pillock like Taylor the opportunity to flash any card staggers me! We know what he's like. You only have to see the video of the CFC game and the red cards that were issued and NOT issued and you see where this guy stands. And another thirty seconds Delph would be walking down the tunnel and bouncing to get out for the second half. What goes through the space between someone's ears in that situation I cannot imagine!               |Dave Ewing's Back 'eader|20 Feb 2018 at 3:07 AM

Delph was the best of the bunch. I personally think we should have signed a proper left back in Jan to act as competition for Mendy. Delph is not a long term solution. He has done well but he isn’t a natural. Like you say they will hit that area. Zinchenko would be a huge risk in a final against a good side on their day.               |Millwallawayveteran1988|20 Feb 2018 at 10:10 AM

MAN_CITY|               Wasn't Delph's ,'Zabaleta moment' the culmination of a few frisky challenges in the previous 5 minutes .It seemed there was a little bit going on with him and certain wigan players that ended with his challenge. My immediate thought was it was a bit of retribution by Delph -the old red mist.               |nellyonthewing|21 Feb 2018 at 2:01 AM

MAN_CITY|               Weird one this, whilst he was banned he appeared in every training video and photo set, then as soon as he becomes eligible again, he disappears? Is Pep Sandbagging? Trying to convince England he's not fit the intl break and is prepared to leave him out last night and v Stoke as a result?

We don’t need him in his favored position and at LB he offers nothing going forward.                  <br>                   <br> Last summers his main suitors were Stoke and WBA I believe, understandable why he choose to stay. If an upper mid table club comes in for him in the next window which I think is likely, it would be best for all parties for the transfer to happen. With Mendy fit, Delph will not see much game especially considering he is not a like for like replacement. Think we can definitely get £25m+ for him. Would be wise to either invest that in a specialist LB or maybe bring back Angeliño.                 </div>                 <div class=""quoteExpand"">                  Click to expand...                 </div>                </blockquote>                </aside>               </div>I sincerely doubt we would be able to get anywhere near 25mil for him.               |billymumphrey|23 Mar 2018 at 5:54 AM

MAN_CITY|               It's a shitter with Delph.              <br>               <br> I think he could be a lot of use to us as midfield backup as well as fullback, but he's made entirely of glass &amp; I'm not sure how many such players we can have around &amp; continue to get away with it.               |Neville Kneville|23 Mar 2018 at 10:05 AM

MAN_CITY|               This guy is unpressable, he is soo good on the ball and dribbled through 2 or 3 players multiple times this match.               <br>               <br> The switch to the back 5 (when sterling went central), meant he had to play as a LWB. If he can do the bits there he can be phenomenal rotation with Mendy in a back 5. He's also great in a back 4 too.               |WallyA|14 Apr 2018 at 10:03 PM
MAN_CITY|               It will be tough for Mendy to retain his position.              <br>               <br> He is the best LB in the league, nevermind the best LB backup.               |Tevez City|14 Apr 2018 at 10:09 PM

MAN_CITY|               We look so much better with Delph at left back , its just his fitness issues that have held him back , but would certainly keep him at the club as back up for Mendy , and maybe give him a few games at DM and give Dinho a well earned rest               |jimmygrimblesboots|15 Apr 2018 at 12:14 AM

MAN_CITY|               Has proved to be an intelligent footballer who has played left back rather than midfield. Full back not a position he would have been familiar with but played it well.               |Kompany is King|22 Apr 2018 at 7:11 PM

MAN_CITY|               Surely we will keep him in our squad; his versatility, quality and attitude (and his home grown status) would make any other choice very hard to understand.               |Matt the Giant|23 Apr 2018 at 7:42 AM

MAN_CITY|               For me, he is a player that I can talk to my kids about, to show as an example. Reasonably talented, not flashy but solid and dependable and gives 100% whenever called upon to do so, without sulking or complaining. Seems to be a very decent man happy to be part of a team where others will always be more talented, or recieve more praise from the general public. I am very happy that he is part of our squad.               |bluebaja|23 Apr 2018 at 7:54 AM

MAN_CITY|               Great season from him and he's been mostly available when needed. He has definitely earned his Premeir league winners medal.               |super_city_si|23 Apr 2018 at 5:43 PM
MAN_CITY|               If he stays fit, well a big if but still, surely he has to feature with England at the World Cup. Would be such a nice feel good story and so fucking deserved. I know he got 2 call ups from Southgate, but it got cancelled due to his ongoing fitness issues. Hopefully they didn't forget him... Especially as he can play a role in either midfield or at left back.               |Hungarian blue|23 Apr 2018 at 9:50 PM

MAN_CITY|               He basically joins the midfield from the left back position so we always have a double pivot. You constantly see him and Dinho moving together and passing to each other.               <br>               <br> Our system ends up looking like a 2-2-4-2 when teams are pinned back, with Walker and Sane high and wide with Sterling joining Jesus/Aguero centrally.              <br>               <br> Pep has mentioned needing to buy 2 more players and almost everyone agrees they are probably a DM and a forward. But if we consider the 2-2-4-2 shape above, it makes more sense to me (atleast financially) to just have Delph be the heir to Dinho, buy another LB (or bring in Angelino) and let Mendy and the new LB out wide on the left (like Walker does often). This free's up Sane to play more centrally, not requiring us to buy another forward as well.               |WallyA|30 Apr 2018 at 12:05 AM

MAN_CITY|               What a footballer. Pure class               |Craig|30 Apr 2018 at 12:34 AM
MAN_CITY|               Pity Delph can't play right back.               |TonyM|30 Apr 2018 at 1:09 AM
MAN_CITY|               3 more starts and no injury. Surely to God he must be going to the World Cup!               |schfc6|30 Apr 2018 at 1:56 PM
MAN_CITY|               The problem with Delph is injuries, obviously, &amp; is unlikely to go away.              <br>               <br> So he isn't really our fullback, nor our alternative def mid, he is, like Vinny, a player we 'hope' will be there but we can't assume he will be, so can't really plan any position with him involved. Even if he plays 30 games over the season, he can still go missing for ten in a row, just when the team gets used to functioniung perfectly with him.              <br>               <br> It's a real shame. I'm sure he could have developed as a centre mid at City, if he'd been available regularly to actually play that position &amp; learn it. he's a much better footballer than he gets (lack of) credit for.              <br>               <br> Great season, nontheless.               |Neville Kneville|1 May 2018 at 8:59 AM
MAN_CITY|               Absolutely fantastic season at City. And turned himself in to a LB that is great for the way Pep wants his team to play. If he will be 1st choice in the national team at the WC I don't care, but I can understand it from the point of view England do not play like City and they should not try to copy it either.               |eversince 76|1 May 2018 at 11:04 AM
MAN_CITY|               New contract please Pep.               |Manchester_lalala|1 May 2018 at 2:50 PM
