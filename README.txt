# How to run
Simple paste the url for the forum thread into the threads.txt file, if you wish to have multiple threads use a comma (with no spaces) to separate them

Ensure the thread URL is exactly what is displayed when you first click on the thread, any interactions may change this url

Click the "run" or "run.bat" file found in the release folder once all of the threads are in the threads.txt file

On windows, if the black box with the white text (the terminal) is stuck and is not producing new lines of text for a while, click on the black box and press enter a few times.

Once the terminal says it is complete check posts.txt to find the scraped forum posts.
